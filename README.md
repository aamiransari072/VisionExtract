# VisionExtract
### Combining computer vision and data extraction.

### About
* This project is an AI-powered **document classification and data extraction system**. It takes an image as input, classifies it into predefined categories, and extracts relevant text using OCR. The classification model predicts the document type, and if it's a valid document, the extraction pipeline retrieves key information. Built using **FastAPI**, the backend integrates **machine learning models** for classification and text recognition. The system supports **image uploads** and processes them in real-time. It utilizes **TensorFlow/PyTorch** for deep learning and **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction. The project is designed for **automating document processing** in financial, legal, and administrative sectors. It aims to enhance accuracy, reduce manual effort, and improve efficiency in handling large-scale document workflows. ðŸš€



## Project WorkFlow 
- User Upload a **image** (hitting route)
- Route will take data nad passed to **CNN based Classifier**
- If image is an **invoice** we will then extract the data
- Using **Tesseract OCR** extract text and passed to **Gemnini Vision**
- It will give Structured JSON resposne

```bash
uvicorn app:app
```

8. Get Request on Train Route to train and Save model
```bash
get request on "/train" route
```

9. For classify and extract
```bash
post request on "/classify_and_extract" route
```
#### Note -  Key point to remember create a .env file and stored GOOGLE_API_KEY
